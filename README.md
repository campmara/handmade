# 30 Days of Handmade Hero

This repository is the dumping grounds for all of my follow-along work with Casey Muratori's [*Handmade Hero*](https://mollyrocket.com/#handmade) series. It's a little old at this point, but I still consider it a pivotal moment for gamedev education online and still an indispensable resource. Recently, I was listening to a game engineering podcast featuring Ryan Fleury as a guest, who mentioned working through the first 30 days of the series way back in the day. He remarked on that first chunk of the series giving him all he really needed to start programming games from scratch in the Casey Muratori style (C with operator overloading, compression oriented functional programming). I'd like to learn more about this, as well as get some core knowledge on game engines, so I'm going to try out these first thirty days myself. I think that's a reasonable section of the series to digest, and from there I can move on to some more specific rendering API work.
