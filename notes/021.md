# Day 021: Loading Game Code Dynamically (!!!)

Casey started off talking about scripting languages and their shortcomings:
1. Debuggers?
2. Performance?

For handmade hero a scripting language will be a bad idea! It would take too much time for not much benefit!

Can we get the benefits of a scripting language without having to actually use one?

One of the major benefits of a scripting language, however, is it makes it easy to edit the scripts while the game is running! So we are going to implement this feature into our game. Visual Studio's Edit and Continue feature doesn't really work for this purpose though.

We have architected things so far in such a way that we have separated our "Game" code into its own files, and the "Platform" code sits in its own files as well. There's a nicely defined boundary between these two things, which is to our benefit with such a system!

We will be taking both layers of the program now and compiling them separately!

We have already seen how to load code from a library dynamically with the LoadLibrary function!!! If we want to do this with our own code, all we have to do is compile it separately and then load it as if it's a DLL! The reason it is simple to do this is partly because we have memory set up in arenas in the GameMemory struct. We can hang onto that memory easily when we unload our DLL and then feed it into the new game code DLL that gets loaded.

## Changing the `build.bat`

```bat
-incremental:no (added this to the HM_LINK variable)

:: We compile two separate files, the game code unit and the platform unit.
call cl %HM_WARNINGS% %HM_DEFINES% %HM_OPTIMIZATIONS% ..\code\handmade.cpp -Fmhandmade.map /LD /link /EXPORT:GameGetSoundSamples /EXPORT:GameUpdateAndRender

call cl %HM_WARNINGS% %HM_DEFINES% %HM_OPTIMIZATIONS% ..\code\win32_handmade.cpp -Fmwin32_handmade.map /link -subsystem:windows %HM_LINK%

```

We also add a /DLL to the game build.

## Moving defines

We moved our #defines into handmade.h, kept a reference to handmade.h in win32_handmade.cpp, and deleted the handmade.cpp reference.

We also removed the "internal" signifier from our handmade.h game and platform function definitions.

After doing all of this we have to resolve all the linker errors.

## Resolving linker errors

For our two game-specific functions in `handmade.h`, we need to do something similar to what we did for the xinput library imports!

```c++
// In handmade.h
#define GAME_UPDATE_AND_RENDER(name) void name(GameMemory *memory, GameInput *input, GameOffscreenBuffer *offscreen_buffer)
typedef GAME_UPDATE_AND_RENDER(game_update_and_render);
GAME_UPDATE_AND_RENDER(GameUpdateAndRenderStub)
{
}

#define GAME_GET_SOUND_SAMPLES(name) void name(GameMemory *memory, GameSoundOutputBuffer *sound_buffer)
typedef GAME_GET_SOUND_SAMPLES(game_get_sound_samples);
GAME_GET_SOUND_SAMPLES(GameGetSoundSamplesStub)
{
}

// We deleted the original functions since these now serve as the function definitions.
```

Then, for each function in `handmade.cpp`, we redeclared them with these new defines:

```c++
// deleted:
// void GameGetSoundSamples(GameMemory *memory, GameSoundOutputBuffer *sound_buffer)
GAME_GET_SOUND_SAMPLES(GameGetSoundSamples)
{
    GameState *game_state = (GameState *)memory->permanent_storage;
    GameOutputSound(sound_buffer, game_state->tone_hz);
}
```

## In `win32_handmade.cpp`

We define a function to load our game code into a GameCode struct, which we then use in our `WinMain` function.

```c++
struct Win32GameCode
{
    HMODULE game_code_dll;

    // Function Pointers
    game_update_and_render *UpdateAndRender;
    game_get_sound_samples *GetSoundSamples;

    bool32 is_valid;
};

internal Win32GameCode Win32LoadGameCode()
{
    Win32GameCode result = {};

    CopyFile("handmade.exe", "handmade_temp.dll", FALSE);
    result.game_code_dll = LoadLibraryA("handmade_temp.dll");
    if (result.game_code_dll)
    {
        result.UpdateAndRender = (game_update_and_render *)GetProcAddress(result.game_code_dll, "GameUpdateAndRender");
        result.GetSoundSamples = (game_get_sound_samples *)GetProcAddress(result.game_code_dll, "GameGetSoundSamples");

        result.is_valid = (result.UpdateAndRender && result.GetSoundSamples);
    }

    if (!result.is_valid)
    {
        result.UpdateAndRender = GameUpdateAndRenderStub;
        result.GetSoundSamples = GameGetSoundSamplesStub;
    }

    return result;
}

internal void Win32UnloadGameCode(Win32GameCode *game_code)
{
    if (game_code->game_code_dll)
    {
        FreeLibrary(game_code->game_code_dll);
        game_code->game_code_dll = 0;
    }

    game_code->is_valid = false;
    game_code->UpdateAndRender = GameUpdateAndRenderStub;
    game_code->GetSoundSamples = GameGetSoundSamplesStub;
}

// In winmain:
{
    // Right before while(global_is_running)
    Win32GameCode game = Win32LoadGameCode();
    uint32 load_counter = 0;

    while(global_is_running)
    {
        if (load_counter++ > 120)
        {
            Win32UnloadGameCode(&game);
            game = Win32LoadGameCode();
            load_counter = 0;
        }
        
        ...
    }

    // calling the functions
    game.UpdateAndRender(...);

    // elsewhere
    game.GetSoundSamples(...);
}
```

## Getting the `DEBUGPlatform` functions into the game dll

We can just pass the function pointers to these through GameMemory!

```c++
// The definitions in handmade.h
#define DEBUG_PLATFORM_READ_ENTIRE_FILE(name) DEBUGReadFileResult name(char *filename)
typedef DEBUG_PLATFORM_READ_ENTIRE_FILE(debug_platform_read_entire_file);

#define DEBUG_PLATFORM_FREE_FILE_MEMORY(name) void name(void *memory)
typedef DEBUG_PLATFORM_FREE_FILE_MEMORY(debug_platform_free_file_memory);

#define DEBUG_PLATFORM_WRITE_ENTIRE_FILE(name) bool32 name(char *filename, uint32 memory_size, void *memory)
typedef DEBUG_PLATFORM_WRITE_ENTIRE_FILE(debug_platform_write_entire_file);

struct GameMemory
{
    ...

    debug_platform_read_entire_file *DEBUGPlatformReadEntireFile;
    debug_platform_free_file_memory *DEBUGPlatformFreeFileMemory;
    debug_platform_write_entire_file *DEBUGPlatformWriteEntireFile;
};
```

This is almost like making our own little vtable, but we can actually see what we're doing!

Then, anywhere we want to call those functions in our game code, we can just prefix with `memory->` and it will work.

The DEBUGPlatformFreeFileMemory function also had to be moved above DEBUGPlatformReadEntireFile because it calls that function (in `win32_handmade.cpp`).

We still need to export our functions to the DLL. Normally people would do this with a bunch of __declspec specifiers on the exported functions, but there's actually another way to do it that doesn't crud up the code with a bunch of windows stuff. You can use /EXPORT on the command line build to do this.

`/EXPORT:functionname` exports a function. However this alone didn't help us export the dll functions because of name mangling.

To avoid the functions we export getting mangled, we have to add the `extern "C"` specifier to the function *definitions* in `handmade.cpp`. This tells the compiler to follow the old-school c-convention and to not mangle the name.

We had to get rid of all of our local_persist variables and put them in the GameState struct.

We also wrote some code to unload and relead the DLL every 120 frames, and used CopyFile to copy the file over to a temp file that would be loaded. Finally, we had to change the default working directory in Visual Studio to the build folder to make this all work (since CopyFile uses that to specify paths).

We then hit a snag where the visual studio debugger was locking the .pdb file for the library, so we were not able to hot reload with the debugger... It worked outside of that though if we just ran the .exe!!!
