# Day 012: Platform-independent Sound Output

## Remember

With our platform API, we design it so that we distinguish between "what services the platform layer provides to the game" and "what services the game provides to the platform layer".

So far we have abstracted only the RenderWeirdGradient code.

## Moving sound across the API boundary

Sound is tricky because it's temporal. It happens over time, and must be playing continuously! Contrasted with video, if we show something on screen, we could potentially lower the sample rate and display at an alternate framerate. Video is a static snapshot in time that is held for a certain amount of time. Sound is not that way, you must be outputting at the same sample rate continuously, any errors will sound bad to the user!

## Casey says...

Most games handle timing very poorly!
