## Pointer Aliasing

Casey explained pointer aliasing and how it's basically when you have two or more pointers to the same thing and the compiler loses track of things.

He recommends that nowadays if things are relatively small you should be trying to pass it by value rather than through passing a pointer reference.

## Putting the `Message` variable declaration inside or outside the loop

Casey explained that there was basically no difference between the two options, and since the `MSG Message` variable was reused across the loop, the stack would still use the same memory space and it would basically be as fast.

The reason why you would want it in or out of the loop would be to signal the intent of the scope of that variable. When you put something in a block of a particular function, you scope the variable down lexically and force its use only within that block and nowhere else. This is a powerful tool!
