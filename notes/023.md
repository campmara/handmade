# Day 023: Looped Live Code Editing

The instantaneous live code editing is nice to have, but still creates a process wherein we have to 
1. run the game, 
2. pick up the controller, 
3. see something is wrong, 
4. put down the controller, 
5. edit the code, 
6. compile, 
7. pick up the controller, 
8. and finally see the change occur and verify that it's working as intended.

To help us avoid some steps here, we are going to engineer a way for us to run the game, record a loop of gameplay to repeat endlessly, and have that loop while we edit the code and recompile. This way, we won't have to keep picking up the controller and replicating the specific game conditions necessary to recreate the parts of the game we're inspecting.

## Recording Input

To do this, we will need a way on our platform layer to record and store input state over frames.

```c++
// In win32_handmade.h
struct Win32RecordedInput
{
    int input_count;
    game_input *input_stream;
};
```

This could work, but in reality we could even read and write this stream from a file! We will do this with file i/o.
