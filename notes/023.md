# Day 023: Looped Live Code Editing

The instantaneous live code editing is nice to have, but still creates a process wherein we have to 
1. run the game, 
2. pick up the controller, 
3. see something is wrong, 
4. put down the controller, 
5. edit the code, 
6. compile, 
7. pick up the controller, 
8. and finally see the change occur and verify that it's working as intended.

To help us avoid some steps here, we are going to engineer a way for us to run the game, record a loop of gameplay to repeat endlessly, and have that loop while we edit the code and recompile. This way, we won't have to keep picking up the controller and replicating the specific game conditions necessary to recreate the parts of the game we're inspecting.

## Recording Input

To do this, we will need a way on our platform layer to record and store input state over frames.

```c++
// In win32_handmade.h
struct Win32RecordedInput
{
    int input_count;
    game_input *input_stream;
};
```

This could work, but in reality we could even read and write this stream from a file! We will do this with file i/o.

## New functions to aid us in live-looping

```c++
internal void Win32BeginRecordingInput(Win32State *win32_state, int input_recording_index)
{
    win32_state->input_recording_index = input_recording_index;
    char *filename = "foo.hmi";
    win32_state->recording_handle = CreateFileA(filename, GENERIC_WRITE, 0, 0, CREATE_ALWAYS, 0, 0);

    DWORD bytes_to_write = (DWORD)win32_state->total_size;
    Assert(win32_state->total_size == bytes_to_write);
    DWORD bytes_written;
    WriteFile(win32_state->recording_handle, win32_state->game_memory_block, bytes_to_write, &bytes_written, 0);
}

internal void Win32EndRecordingInput(Win32State *win32_state)
{
    CloseHandle(win32_state->recording_handle);
    win32_state->input_recording_index = 0;
}

internal void Win32BeginInputPlayback(Win32State *win32_state, int input_playing_index)
{
    win32_state->input_playing_index = input_playing_index;
    char *filename = "foo.hmi";
    win32_state->playback_handle = CreateFileA(filename, GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, 0, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, 0);

    DWORD bytes_to_read = (DWORD)win32_state->total_size;
    Assert(win32_state->total_size == bytes_to_read);
    DWORD bytes_read;
    ReadFile(win32_state->playback_handle, win32_state->game_memory_block, bytes_to_read, &bytes_read, 0);
}

internal void Win32EndInputPlayback(Win32State *win32_state)
{
    CloseHandle(win32_state->playback_handle);
    win32_state->input_playing_index;
}

internal void Win32RecordInput(Win32State *win32_state, GameInput *new_input)
{
    DWORD bytes_written;
    WriteFile(win32_state->recording_handle, new_input, sizeof(*new_input), &bytes_written, 0);
}

internal void Win32PlaybackInput(Win32State *win32_state, GameInput *new_input)
{
    DWORD bytes_read = 0;
    if (ReadFile(win32_state->playback_handle, new_input, sizeof(*new_input), &bytes_read, 0))
    {
        if (bytes_read == 0)
        {
            // We've hit the end of the stream, go back to the beginning.
            int playing_index = win32_state->input_playing_index;
            Win32EndInputPlayback(win32_state);
            Win32BeginInputPlayback(win32_state, playing_index);
            ReadFile(win32_state->playback_handle, new_input, sizeof(*new_input), &bytes_read, 0);
        }
    }
}
```

We added the following usage code to our `Win32ProcessPendingMessages` function:

```c++
else if (vk_code == 'L')
{
    if (is_down)
    {
        if (win32_state->input_recording_index == 0)
        {
            Win32BeginRecordingInput(win32_state, 1);
        }
        else
        {
            Win32EndRecordingInput(win32_state);
            Win32BeginInputPlayback(win32_state, 1);
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, we added the following to our main loop, right before the call to `GameUpdateAndRender`:

```c++
if (win32_state.input_recording_index)
{
    Win32RecordInput(&win32_state, new_input);
}

if (win32_state.input_playing_index)
{
    Win32PlaybackInput(&win32_state, new_input);
}
game.UpdateAndRender(&game_memory, new_input, &offscreen_buffer);
```

As you can see, this was a very simple change to get live code editing working with a loop recording! The way that we architected our game (allocating memory for game state in one big chunk at a known address) made it trivial to do something like this. Amazing!
