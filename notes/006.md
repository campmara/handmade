# Day 006: Gamepad and Keyboard Input

We implement gamepad input by using the XInput library. This library is apparently very simple!

[XINPUT DOCS HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/xinput/getting-started-with-xinput#using-xinput)

The following is an example of polling for input from XInput in our main update loop, after handling window messages.

```c++
for (DWORD controller_idx = 0; controller_idx < XUSER_MAX_COUNT; ++controller_idx)
{
    XINPUT_STATE controller_state;
    if (XInputGetState(controller_idx, &controller_state) == ERROR_SUCCESS)
    {
        // NOTE(mara): This controller is plugged in
        XINPUT_GAMEPAD *pad = &controller_state.Gamepad;
        bool dpad_up = (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_DPAD_UP);
        bool dpad_down = (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_DPAD_DOWN);
        bool dpad_left = (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_DPAD_LEFT);
        bool dpad_right = (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_DPAD_RIGHT);
        bool start = (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_START);
        bool back = (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_BACK);
        bool left_shoulder = (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_LEFT_SHOULDER);
        bool right_shoulder = (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_RIGHT_SHOULDER);
        bool a_button = (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_A);
        bool b_button = (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_B);
        bool x_button = (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_X);
        bool y_button = (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_Y);

        int16 stick_x = pad->sThumbLX;
        int16 stick_y = pad->sThumbLY;
    }
    else
    {
        // NOTE(mara): The controller is not available
    }
}

```

This was all pretty simple to understand! I feel like a really valuable skill I'm picking up (after nearly a decade programming) is keeping those docs open! Unity really doesn't enforce this, and you sort of get accustomed to doing google searches every so often!

## Linking the library...

Casey decided not to link to Xinput.lib in the build.bat file. This is because there might be certain circumstances where a user's machine might not have Xinput available!

Instead, he chose to dynamically link the library like so:

```c++
#define XINPUT_GET_STATE(name) DWORD WINAPI name(DWORD dwUserIndex, XINPUT_STATE *pState)
typedef XINPUT_GET_STATE(xinput_get_state);

XINPUT_GET_STATE(XInputGetStateStub)
{
    return(0);
}
global xinput_get_state *XInputGetState_ = XInputGetStateStub;
#define XInputGetState XInputGetState_

#define XINPUT_SET_STATE(name) DWORD WINAPI name(DWORD dwUserIndex, XINPUT_VIBRATION *pVibration)
typedef XINPUT_SET_STATE(xinput_set_state);
XINPUT_SET_STATE(XInputSetStateStub)
{
    return(0);
}
global xinput_set_state *XInputSetState_ = XInputSetStateStub;
#define XInputSetState XInputSetState_
```

In this case, we are defining types that are functions, allowing us to define function pointers elsewhere to resolve the location of these libraries. This is called dynamically loading your libraries.

The order is thus:
1. Define the function prototype once for the thing you want.
2. Define a type of that so you can use it as a pointer to a function later.
3. Defining a stub for it as well, so all we have to do to change the function signature later is to change it in the define.
4. Then defining the function pointer.

Now that this is setup, if the program tries to use the function and it's not defined (in the case that the xinput library is not available, this will just resolve to 0).

## The `LoadLibrary` Function

We loaded the XInput library in a function we wrote that called LoadLibrary on the name of the xinput dll and then checked that, thereafter loading it into the function pointer globals we specified earlier.

Apparently, doing this in your program explicitly is doing what the compiler is going to do already for you when you link a library to your program. It's just that this time around you've got those nice little stubs to use that won't crash your program when the library isn't loaded! Nice!!!

## `WPARAM` and `LPARAM`

These are both 64-bit values that take on whatever meaning they need to take on for the message coming into the window callback function.
