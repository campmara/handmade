# Day 019: Improving Audio Synchronization

We want to make sure there are no audio sync issues, and part of that involves trying to have some measure of control over when samples are going out. We want them to go out during the time period that corresponds to the frame that we want to hear them on.

We need to use GetCurrentPosition from DirectSound in order to do this, and to help us out we are going to make a little debug draw diagram to visualize it (!!!).

We defined the following functions to help us do this:

```c++
internal void Win32DebugDrawVertical(Win32OffscreenBuffer *backbuffer,
                                     int x, int top, int bottom, uint32 color)
{
    uint8 *pixel = ((uint8 *)backbuffer->memory +
                    x * backbuffer->bytes_per_pixel +
                    top * backbuffer->pitch);
    for (int y = top; y < bottom; ++y)
    {
        *(uint32 *)pixel = color;
        pixel += backbuffer->pitch;
    }
}

internal void Win32DrawSoundBufferMarker(Win32OffscreenBuffer *backbuffer,
                                         Win32SoundOutput *sound_output,
                                         real32 c, int pad_x, int top, int bottom,
                                         DWORD cursor_value, uint32 color)
{
    Assert(cursor_value < sound_output->secondary_buffer_size);
    real32 x_real32 = (c * (real32)cursor_value);
    int x = pad_x + (int)x_real32;
    Win32DebugDrawVertical(backbuffer, x, top, bottom, color);
}

internal void Win32DebugSyncDisplay(Win32OffscreenBuffer *backbuffer,
                                    Win32SoundOutput *sound_output,
                                    int marker_count,
                                    Win32DebugTimeMarker *markers,
                                    real32 target_seconds_per_frame)
{
    int pad_x = 16;
    int pad_y = 16;

    int top = pad_y;
    int bottom = backbuffer->height - pad_y;

    real32 c = (real32)(backbuffer->width - (2 * pad_x)) / (real32)sound_output->secondary_buffer_size;
    for (int marker_index = 0; marker_index < marker_count; ++marker_index)
    {
        Win32DebugTimeMarker *this_marker = &markers[marker_index];
        Win32DrawSoundBufferMarker(backbuffer, sound_output,
                                   c, pad_x, top, bottom,
                                   this_marker->play_cursor, 0xFFFFFFFF);
        Win32DrawSoundBufferMarker(backbuffer, sound_output,
                                   c, pad_x, top, bottom,
                                   this_marker->write_cursor, 0xFFFF0000);
    }
}
```

Sound is broken currently, and we need to figure out exactly how far ahead of the play cursor we should actually be writing.

After some debugging, we found that the issue was that we were not giving the sound output enough latency. We need even more latency!
