# Day 018: Enforcing a Video Frame Rate

Currently none of our subsystems are synchronized in time, so if we were to try to make a game we would run into all sorts of latency and timing issues!

Every frame, we are computing the next frame to show on screen. When that gets shown we immediately set to work computing the next frame. We also want the audio for each frame to be computed and output in time with these frames.

We want to have a fixed duration to compute the next frame. We will have a fixed timescale to acheive this. With variable refresh rate monitors we want to be synchronized with the refresh rate! If we were updating at a different rate than the monitor we will eventually miss a frame! We want the refresh rates to be the same as a goal. We can either do our updates at the monitor refresh rate OR some subdivision of that (e.g. 120hz -> 60fps).

Typically we need to store the amount of time it takes to compute a frame, and then we update various subsystems with that amount of time so that they can use it in their timing calculations.

We never want our framerate to be variable. Casey says that your physics in a variable framerate are always WRONG. (I assume Unity has the split timing between fixed and variable to solve this problem, I wonder how other game engines solve this?)

We are updating with a particular time target in mind and everything feeds off of that! If we miss the fixed time by taking too long, our audio might skip though. This presents us with two options:
* Always get the audio there on time (fix framerate strictly and never allow it to go over).
* Always feed the audio further ahead.
  * This way, if we have time, we don't have to use that feed either, we could calculate a better version in the time we have left.
  * Could also spawn a guard thread to serve the audio.

## The Multiple Monitor Question

We are not yet sure the best way to get the current monitor's refresh rate, so we will have to tackle this later.

### Don't ship a game that uses __rdtsc for actual game time!

## What is a scheduler?

Inside every OS, there's something called a *scheduler* which is something that decides when certain threads run. It's what lets you run multiple programs at once, and doles out the CPU to the various programs so that they can do their work. This scheduler basically has to interrupt in order to do its work! However frequently the scheduler wakes up is the minimum amount of time you can call `Sleep()` for!

## The Code

We defined the following functions to help us with timing:

```c++
inline LARGE_INTEGER Win32GetWallClock()
{
    LARGE_INTEGER result;
    QueryPerformanceCounter(&result);
    return result;
}

inline real32 Win32GetSecondsElapsed(LARGE_INTEGER start, LARGE_INTEGER end)
{
    real32 result = ((real32)(end.QuadPart - start.QuadPart) /
                     (real32)global_perf_count_frequency);
    return result;
}
```

And then used them in WinMain like this:

On Startup:
```c++
LARGE_INTEGER perf_count_frequency_result;
QueryPerformanceFrequency(&perf_count_frequency_result);
global_perf_count_frequency = perf_count_frequency_result.QuadPart;

// NOTE(mara): Set the windows scheduler granularity to 1 ms so that our sleep can be more
// granular.
UINT desired_scheduler_ms = 1;
bool32 sleep_is_granular = (timeBeginPeriod(desired_scheduler_ms) == TIMERR_NOERROR);

...

// TODO(mara): How do we reliably query this on windows??
int monitor_refresh_hz = 60;
int game_update_hz = monitor_refresh_hz / 2;
real32 target_seconds_per_frame = 1.0f / (real32)game_update_hz;
```

At the end of the main loop:
```c++
LARGE_INTEGER work_counter = Win32GetWallClock();
real32 work_seconds_elapsed = Win32GetSecondsElapsed(last_counter, work_counter);

// TODO(mara): NOT TESTED YET! PROBABLY BUGGY!!!!!!!!
real32 seconds_elapsed_for_frame = work_seconds_elapsed;
if (seconds_elapsed_for_frame < target_cursor)
{
    if (sleep_is_granular)
    {
        DWORD sleep_ms = (DWORD)(1000.0f * (target_seconds_per_frame - seconds_elapsed_for_frame));
        if (sleep_ms > 0)
        {
          Sleep(sleep_ms);
        }
    }
    while (seconds_elapsed_for_frame < target_seconds_per_frame)
    {
        seconds_elapsed_for_frame = Win32GetSecondsElapsed(last_counter, Win32GetWallClock());
    }
}
else
{
    // TODO(mara): MISSED FRAME RATE!!!
    // TODO(mara): Logging
}

// DisplayBuffer function

// Input clearing

LARGE_INTEGER end_counter = Win32GetWallClock();
real32 ms_per_frame = 1000.0f * Win32GetSecondsElapsed(last_counter, end_counter);
last_counter = end_counter;

uint64 end_cycle_count = __rdtsc();
uint64 cycles_elapsed = end_cycle_count - last_cycle_count;
last_cycle_count = end_cycle_count;

// FPS display buffer stuff
```
