# Day 008: Writing a Square Wave to DirectSound

## On vtables and methods

There is a catch to putting methods and virtual methods in your classes / structs. The difference with just a normal non-virtual function is Only syntactic. It forces that method to be local only to that object. Implicitly, the compiler will insert a *this pointer into your function in order to reference that structure's members under the hood. Casey says it's purely syntactic in C++!

With virtual, it's more complicated (and not just syntactic). Virtual causes the compiler to insert a vtable pointer to the object that lets the compiler look up the function pointers that it needs in order to resolve which function pointer that call corresponds to (based on what the object type was that called the function). Virtual functions hit the double indirection issue (where you are going to the location of one pointer which is then also a pointer to another location). This costs you performance every time you use virtual!!

*Zero Cost Abstractions* are language features that are purely syntactic and cost nothing to perform. Be aware of what these are in your language!

## `IDirectSoundBuffer8::Lock`

We are going to write our sound into the buffer, and when it's playing and gets to the end of the buffer, it will loop back to the beginning.

We need to lock a region of the buffer in order to write into it. It gives us back potentially two regions. One if we ask for less than the end of the buffer, and two for if the buffer circles back. We have to handle both cases (full buffer section or two portions of it).

Sound buffers have samples that look like this:

```c++
// each left and right is 16bits (int16)
// each pair of left and right is a single sample
// [LEFT RIGHT] LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT ...
```

They are interleaved. 

## Square Waves

We set up a simple square wave with a period of 261 hz, in order to play a middle c.

Square waves are basically just a positive value and then a negative value sample-over-sample.

## Writing and playing sound

We can't normally write right at the play cursor in the buffer because of latency issues. That's why we have the write cursor. It's always just a little bit ahead of the play cursor.

We have two special cases to handle when writing.

1. byte_to_write is greater than the play cursor
   1. in this case, we have the rest of the buffer to write to, as well as the first part of the buffer leading up to the play cursor
2. byte_to_write is less than the play cursor
   1. we only have the area up to the play cursor to write to

The code looks like this:

```c++
// In the main loop!
int samples_per_second = 48000;
int tone_hz = 256;
int16 tone_volume = 2000;
uint32 running_sample_index = 0;
int square_wave_period = samples_per_second / tone_hz;
int half_square_wave_period = square_wave_period / 2;
int bytes_per_sample = sizeof(int16) * 2;
int secondary_buffer_size = samples_per_second * bytes_per_sample;

DWORD play_cursor;
DWORD write_cursor;
if (SUCCEEDED(global_secondary_buffer->GetCurrentPosition(&play_cursor,
                                                         &write_cursor)))
{
   DWORD byte_to_lock = running_sample_index * bytes_per_sample % secondary_buffer_size;
   DWORD bytes_to_write; // number of bytes total to write into the buffer.
   if (byte_to_lock == play_cursor)
   {
      bytes_to_write = secondary_buffer_size;
   }
   else if (byte_to_lock > play_cursor)
   {
      bytes_to_write = (secondary_buffer_size - byte_to_lock);
      bytes_to_write += play_cursor;
   }
   else
   {
      bytes_to_write = play_cursor - byte_to_lock;
   }

   // TODO(mara): More stenuous test please!
   // TODO(mara): Switch to a sine wave.
   void *region1;
   DWORD region1_size;
   VOID *region2;
   DWORD region2_size;
   if (SUCCEEDED(global_secondary_buffer->Lock(byte_to_lock, bytes_to_write,
                                                &region1, &region1_size,
                                                &region2, &region2_size,
                                                0)))
   {
      // TODO(mara): assert that region1_size/region2_size is valid
      DWORD region1_sample_count = region1_size / bytes_per_sample;
      int16 *sample_out = (int16 *)region1;
      for (DWORD sample_index = 0; sample_index < region1_sample_count; ++sample_index)
      {
            int16 sample_value = ((running_sample_index++ / half_square_wave_period) % 2) ? tone_volume : -tone_volume;
            *sample_out++ = sample_value;
            *sample_out++ = sample_value;
      }

      DWORD region2_sample_count = region2_size / bytes_per_sample;
      sample_out = (int16 *)region2;
      for (DWORD sample_index = 0; sample_index < region2_sample_count; ++sample_index)
      {
            int16 sample_value = ((running_sample_index++ / half_square_wave_period) % 2) ? tone_volume : -tone_volume;
            *sample_out++ = sample_value;
            *sample_out++ = sample_value;
      }

      if (SUCCEEDED(global_secondary_buffer->Unlock(region1, region1_size,
                                                      region2, region2_size)))
      {
      }
   }
}

if (!is_sound_playing)
{
   if (SUCCEEDED(global_secondary_buffer->Play(0, 0, DSBPLAY_LOOPING)))
   {
      is_sound_playing = true;
   }
}
```

Latency is always an issue to consider with this sort of programming!
