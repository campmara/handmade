## Day 001

## Command Prompt

`subst` command substitutes one location with a name you set.

`subst w: c:\work` is what Casey did to create the Handmade directory.

## Builds

Casey likes to build everything in a `built.bat` file. It was a really simple setup involving basically just the creation of a build folder and then the `cl` MSVC build command compiling the `win32_handmade.cpp` file.

On top of this, we also set up the dev environment. Not much here is super crazy but he walked through concepts like setting up a work directory with `subst`, setting up an emacs config and a batch file to load it (in the `misc` folder), setting up a `shell.bat` and creating a Command Prompt shortcut to load that (located in the `misc` folder as well), as well as using `devenv` to open the built executable in Visual Studio and debugging in there.
