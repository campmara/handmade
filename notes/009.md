# Day 009: Variable-Pitch Sine Wave Output

## Story time

Long ago, Casey used to be part of the first indie game jam. Chris Hecker and Sean Barrett organized it. They tried to figure out how to make games that could have 100,000 guys on a screen! It took place in a barn in Oakland (lol). One of the last of these jams that Casey participated in was an audio-based game jam. In those days, the engines were made before the jam and then people would use that codebase to make the games.

In this audio jam, this now-oculus guy was doing sound for the engine and showing Casey how it worked. He was playing sound out of these normal headphones plugged into the laptop. Casey brought some extremely expensive headphones. He plugged his headphones in, and noticed there was an audio bug that could only be heard on those headphones!

The moral of the story is that it's surprising how much variance there is when you output sound with different devices and methods!! Lots of mutation occurs on the platform and on the device that can potentially obscure the truth of what you hear!

## Bugfixing

We fixed a bug with our checking for the case in which `byte_to_lock` and `play_cursor` were equal. We initially were writing the entire size of the buffer to the `bytes_to_write` value, and therefore the next time we came around the loop, the `byte_to_lock` value would essentially be equal to the play cursor again! We don't want this.

```c++
// Initial code
DWORD byte_to_lock = running_sample_index * bytes_per_sample % secondary_buffer_size;
DWORD bytes_to_write; // number of bytes total to write into the buffer.
if (byte_to_lock == play_cursor)
{
    bytes_to_write = secondary_buffer_size;
}
...

// fixed code

```

Also, square waves are not the best at diagnosing sound errors!

## Tangent on Fixed Point Math

With a 32 bit integer, imagine partitioning it by bytes (4 bytes).

```c++
// 31st bit |-number-|-number-|-number-|-fraction-| 0th bit
int32 whole_number = Number.Fractional;
```

Before floating point numbers, we would have to fraction out the bits. (Say the bottom 8 bits are the fraction, and the top 24 bits are the number).

With this abstraction, we could get just the number if we wanted by truncating with `whole_number >> 8`. We could also round the number with the following: `whole_number = (w + (frac / 2)) >> 8`.

## Floating point is completely different

```c++
// mantissa: the fraction of 1
// exponent: power of 2 that says how big the number is (2 ^ exponent)
// sb: sign bit, positive or negative
|--sb--|--exponent--|---------mantissa---------|
```

When the exponent is high, you start to lose precision as more bits will have to be reserved for the exponent that the mantissa can't use.

Nowadays we are mostly dealing with floating point math! Everybody does it. Your hardware is now built to make it fast. Don't get tricked into believing fixed point math is better! Your hardware will hate you for it.

## Sin wave code:

```c++
void Win32FillSoundBuffer(Win32SoundOutput *sound_output, DWORD byte_to_lock, DWORD bytes_to_write)
{
    void *region1;
    DWORD region1_size;
    VOID *region2;
    DWORD region2_size;
    if (SUCCEEDED(global_secondary_buffer->Lock(byte_to_lock, bytes_to_write,
                                                &region1, &region1_size,
                                                &region2, &region2_size,
                                                0)))
    {
        DWORD region1_sample_count = region1_size / sound_output->bytes_per_sample;
        int16 *sample_out = (int16 *)region1;
        for (DWORD sample_index = 0; sample_index < region1_sample_count; ++sample_index)
        {
            real32 sine_value = sinf(sound_output->t_sine);
            int16 sample_value = (int16)(sine_value * sound_output->tone_volume);
            *sample_out++ = sample_value;
            *sample_out++ = sample_value;

            sound_output->t_sine += 2.0f * PI_32 * 1.0f / (real32)sound_output->wave_period;
            ++sound_output->running_sample_index;
        }

        DWORD region2_sample_count = region2_size / sound_output->bytes_per_sample;
        sample_out = (int16 *)region2;
        for (DWORD sample_index = 0; sample_index < region2_sample_count; ++sample_index)
        {
            real32 sine_value = sinf(sound_output->t_sine);
            int16 sample_value = (int16)(sine_value * sound_output->tone_volume);
            *sample_out++ = sample_value;
            *sample_out++ = sample_value;

            sound_output->t_sine += 2.0f * PI_32 * 1.0f / (real32)sound_output->wave_period;
            ++sound_output->running_sample_index;
        }

        global_secondary_buffer->Unlock(region1, region1_size,
                                        region2, region2_size);
    }
}
