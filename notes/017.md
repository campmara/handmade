# Day 017: Unified Keyboard and Gamepad Input

## On functional programming

A functional function does not modify anything except what is passed into the function. A function with side effects (does stuff to state or global variables that exist outside of the function). Casey prefers to employ a more functional style of programming as much as possible, to simplify the codebase.

### 1. Pass things as parameters instead of using global state.
### 2. Pass things by value instead of by reference as much as possible.
### 3. Limit the things passed in to what the function absolutely needs to run.

We added keyboard input state to our GameInput struct and increased the number of controllers therein!

## Fixing deadzone issues

We are applying a region around zero that we will treat as a "Zero" input value. We will use Xinput's value for this purpose on the Win32 platform layer.

```c++
#define XINPUT_GAMEPAD_LEFT_THUMB_DEADZONE  7849
#define XINPUT_GAMEPAD_RIGHT_THUMB_DEADZONE 8689
#define XINPUT_GAMEPAD_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD    30
```

We also bound the dpad buttons to analog stick values. The code came out like this:

```c++
// In the main loop controller poll loop
new_controller->is_analog = true;
new_controller->stick_average_x = Win32ProcessXInputStickValue(pad->sThumbLX,
                                        XINPUT_GAMEPAD_LEFT_THUMB_DEADZONE);

new_controller->stick_average_y = Win32ProcessXInputStickValue(pad->sThumbLY,
                                        XINPUT_GAMEPAD_LEFT_THUMB_DEADZONE);

if (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_DPAD_UP)
{
    new_controller->stick_average_y = 1.0f;
}

if (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_DPAD_DOWN)
{
    new_controller->stick_average_y = -1.0f;
}

if (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_DPAD_LEFT)
{
    new_controller->stick_average_x = -1.0f;
}

if (pad->wButtons & XINPUT_GAMEPAD_DPAD_RIGHT)
{
    new_controller->stick_average_x = 1.0f;
}

real32 threshold = 0.5f;
Win32ProcessXInputDigitalButton((new_controller->stick_average_y > threshold) ? 1 : 0,
                                1,
                                &prev_controller->move_up,
                                &new_controller->move_up);
Win32ProcessXInputDigitalButton((new_controller->stick_average_y < -threshold) ? 1 : 0,
                                1,
                                &prev_controller->move_down,
                                &new_controller->move_down);
Win32ProcessXInputDigitalButton((new_controller->stick_average_x < -threshold) ? 1 : 0,
                                1,
                                &prev_controller->move_left,
                                &new_controller->move_left);
Win32ProcessXInputDigitalButton((new_controller->stick_average_x > threshold) ? 1 : 0,
                                1,
                                &prev_controller->move_right,
                                &new_controller->move_right);
```
